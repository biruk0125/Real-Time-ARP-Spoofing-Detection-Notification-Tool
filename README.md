# ARP Spoofing Detection Tool

A real-time defensive network security tool that monitors ARP traffic to detect, log, and alert on ARP spoofing (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks.  
Built with Python, Scapy, and PyQt5.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Real-Time Monitoring
- Continuously sniffs ARP packets on the active network interface.

### 🚨 Spoof Detection
- Automatically detects conflicting IP-to-MAC address mappings.
- Flags suspicious behavior indicative of ARP spoofing attacks.

### 📊 Live Dashboard
- **Traffic Graphs:** Visualizes conflict frequency over time and per IP.  
- **ARP Table:** Displays live IP–MAC mappings and highlights spoofed entries.  
- **Event Feed:** Scrollable log of detected spoofing activity.

### 🔔 Alerts
- Visual pop-up warnings.  
- Audible alerts on detection.

### 📝 Reporting & Forensics
- Automatic ARP table snapshots (JSON / CSV).  
- Exportable PDF reports for analysis or documentation.

### 🌐 Cross-Platform Core
- Automatically selects the active network interface.  
- Linux recommended (best Scapy support).

## 🔧 Installation

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+  
- Linux (Kali / Ubuntu recommended)

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install scapy PyQt5 psutil matplotlib reportlab
```

**Linux Notes**
- Scapy requires elevated privileges to sniff network traffic. Run the application with `sudo`.  
- If PyQt5 system libraries are missing:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the application:
```bash
sudo python3 arp_monitor_app.py
```

### Interface Behavior
- Automatically selects the active interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0).  
- Graphs populate as ARP traffic is observed.  
- Alerts trigger when an IP changes its MAC mapping unexpectedly.

### Exporting Data
- **File → Save Snapshot:** Export current ARP table.  
- **File → Export PDF Report:** Generate a forensic summary report.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Detection sensitivity can be adjusted in the GUI:

- **Alert Threshold:** Number of conflicting ARP packets required before triggering an alert.  
  *(Default: 1)*
